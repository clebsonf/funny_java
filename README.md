# Java

A repository with a bunch of java algorithms, beginners friendly.

So why not add the java algorithms in this repository? We can share with all the world so people can have fun with us!

# You can contribute in two ways:

create file with the title of the algorithm as the filename(.md ), and paste some code showing an example of that algorithm inside a folder, name the folder with the type of the algorithm. Example: (Algorithm: CountingSort.java, folder: sort).

Translate into your language.

It is always fun to check new algorithms or see how the same algorithms can be rewritten in different ways.

# Enjoyed?

Leave a ‚≠ê to the repository and share this with your friends!
