# Definition

```
System.out.println(); --> Is used to print in terminal an argument that is passed to it. 
themes worked better later:
public --> public keyword is an access modifier, which means it is used to define the level of access for classes, attributes, methods and constructors to the public level
String[] args --> contains the supplied command-line arguments as an array of String objects. 
```

# Example

```java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

# Output

Show in terminal: 

Hello World
